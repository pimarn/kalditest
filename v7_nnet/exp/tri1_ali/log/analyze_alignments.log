At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 14.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (94,94.4,126) frames.
At utterance end, p^_E accounts for 1.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 80.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (21,27.9,86) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 20.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,19.2,36) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 19.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (58,57.8,121) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 12.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,11.6,24) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 12.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,41.9,88) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 6.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (64,61.5,105) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 6.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,10.5,28) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,32.5,91) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 5.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,38.3,92) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 5.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,28.6,71) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 5.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,29.9,39) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 33.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 83.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 23.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 14.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (40,47.5,96)
