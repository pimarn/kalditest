At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 93.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,91.9,140) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (41,41.0,41) frames.
At utterance begin, k_B accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (41,41.0,41) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 93.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (64,71.3,108) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 75.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (17,22.7,67) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 24.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (68,66.2,108) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 22.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,21.7,40) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 10.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,9.5,24) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 10.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,17.6,57) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,39.7,85) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,10.9,29) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 7.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,36.9,74) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,55.7,138) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,12.3,39) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,28.0,35) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 48.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 37.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 18.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (66,59.9,85)
