At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (119,125.0,120) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (156,169.7,168) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 66.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,16.1,39) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 33.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (119,117.3,168) frames.
Overall, kl_B accounts for 22.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, uua_E accounts for 11.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,30.3,37) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,41.5,15) frames.
Overall, n^_E accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,16.5,3) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 3.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 3.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, kh_I accounts for 3.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (20,20.0,20) frames.
Overall, ng^_I accounts for 3.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,25.0,25) frames.
Overall, vv_I accounts for 3.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 78.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 34.3% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 37.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 14.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,57.3,53)
