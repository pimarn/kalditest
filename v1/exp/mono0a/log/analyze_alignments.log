At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (84,83.9,101) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (103,108.8,153) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 50.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,35.7,54) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 49.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,41.9,109) frames.
Overall, N accounts for 28.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,38.7,55) frames.
Overall, Y accounts for 22.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (33,32.0,36) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 53.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 68.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 31.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 42.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,23.1,31)
