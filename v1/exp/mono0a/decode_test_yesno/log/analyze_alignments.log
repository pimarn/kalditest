At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (84,84.6,114) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (98,96.6,120) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 52.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,38.7,108) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 47.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,32.3,39) frames.
Overall, Y accounts for 28.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (31,31.2,36) frames.
Overall, N accounts for 19.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (34,34.0,42) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 57.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 70.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 38.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 46.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,23.8,33)
