At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 56.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,14.9,44) frames.
At utterance begin, k_B accounts for 56.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,14.9,44) frames.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 43.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (32,80.7,105) frames.

At utterance end, aa_E accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (71,71.0,71) frames.
At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 79.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,25.8,76) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 24.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,20.9,41) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 20.3% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,47.3,113) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 11.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (45,39.7,86) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 11.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,14.9,66) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 8.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,16.0,61) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 8.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,30.0,77) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,39.7,77) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 2.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (50,58.7,93) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 2.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,6.8,12) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 2.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,23.3,28) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 31.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 90.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 26.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 17.6% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (24,43.1,112)
