analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 56.25% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 75.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 56.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (62,81.2,145) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 43.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.7,5) frames.
At utterance begin, k_B accounts for 43.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.7,5) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 75.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,54.6,85) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 25.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,32.5,16) frames.
At utterance end, aa_E accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,61.5,16) frames.
At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.5,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 76.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,29.0,74) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 25.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,21.1,41) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 23.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,46.9,114) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 13.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (51,47.6,104) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 9.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (36,38.7,71) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 9.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,22.5,71) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 5.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,13.3,37) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 5.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,24.1,62) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 2.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (47,65.8,138) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 2.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,9.1,17) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 2.6% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (23,21.9,28) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 33.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 89.2% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 26.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 20.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,41.9,114)
