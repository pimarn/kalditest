analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence SIL is seen only 65.0% of the time at utterance begin.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 65.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,85.0,132) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 35.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.1,4) frames.
At utterance begin, k_B accounts for 35.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.1,4) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 82.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (64,65.9,121) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 17.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,93.7,126) frames.
At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (83,77.2,100) frames.
At utterance end, p^_E accounts for 5.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (86,110.5,86) frames.
At utterance end, aa_E accounts for 2.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (126,126.0,126) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 83.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,27.6,85) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 21.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,20.8,39) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 16.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (72,68.1,123) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 12.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,29.7,90) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 12.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (18,33.2,79) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (16,27.9,68) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (12,30.3,88) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 6.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,32.8,98) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 5.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,44.0,102) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 5.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (10,11.9,26) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 5.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,24.7,33) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 32.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 90.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 27.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 13.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (72,66.1,118)
