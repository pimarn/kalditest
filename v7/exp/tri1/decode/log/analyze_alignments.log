At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 87.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (91,112.1,173) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,52.0,43) frames.
At utterance begin, k_B accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (43,52.0,43) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 93.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (48,60.3,99) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 6.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,24.0,24) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 76.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (19,23.9,72) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 24.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (66,65.6,108) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 23.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (27,23.1,42) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 11.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (5,9.1,22) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 11.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (9,21.7,68) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (15,36.0,74) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,42.1,89) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 7.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,10.0,24) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 2.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (53,62.5,128) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 2.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,13.7,39) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 2.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,27.7,33) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 46.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 81.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 35.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 18.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (64,57.6,85)
