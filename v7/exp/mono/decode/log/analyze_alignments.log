At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 87.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (88,106.1,146) frames.
At utterance begin, nonsilence accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,36.5,3) frames.
At utterance begin, k_B accounts for 12.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,36.5,3) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 80.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (35,57.0,104) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,70.3,85) frames.
At utterance end, j^_E accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,70.3,85) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 75.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (24,27.5,78) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 24.5% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (66,62.4,108) frames.
Overall, k_B accounts for 24.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,22.4,40) frames.
Overall, aa_E accounts for 12.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (51,45.7,82) frames.
Overall, o_I accounts for 7.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,36.3,85) frames.
Overall, p^_E accounts for 7.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,5.4,11) frames.
Overall, a_I accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,11.6,23) frames.
Overall, j^_E accounts for 7.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (37,38.1,74) frames.
Overall, aa_I accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (25,59.8,138) frames.
Overall, kr_B accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,8.8,14) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 3.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (29,28.1,34) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 42.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 82.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 32.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 19.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (62,54.6,91)
