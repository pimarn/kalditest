The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 35.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 66.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.3 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,13.5,32)
