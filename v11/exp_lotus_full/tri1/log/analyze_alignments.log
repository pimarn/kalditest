The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 77.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 15.7 hours of data, or 11.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,26.7,69)
