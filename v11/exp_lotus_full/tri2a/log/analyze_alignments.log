The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 77.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 9.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 15.7 hours of data, or 11.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.8% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (21,25.9,68)
