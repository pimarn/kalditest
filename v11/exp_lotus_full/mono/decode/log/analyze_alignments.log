The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 36.6% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 66.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 4.9% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.3 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,18.0,37)
