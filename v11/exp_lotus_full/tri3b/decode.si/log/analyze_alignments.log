The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 34.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 66.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 3.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.3 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (7,11.1,28)
