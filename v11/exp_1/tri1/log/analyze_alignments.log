The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 24.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 91.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 16.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.9 hours of data, or 4.4 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (36,38.6,84)
