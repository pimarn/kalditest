The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 54.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 49.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 10.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.3 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 5.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (15,21.3,61)
