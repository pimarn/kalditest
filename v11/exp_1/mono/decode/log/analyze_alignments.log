The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 37.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 64.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 6.6% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.3 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (17,21.0,47)
