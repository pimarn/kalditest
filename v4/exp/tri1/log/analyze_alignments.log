The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 31.8% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 21.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 13.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (27,32.6,54)
