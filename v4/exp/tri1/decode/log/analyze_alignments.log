The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 32.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 77.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 25.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 13.2% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (29,37.3,86)
